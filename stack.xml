  <description brief="Zeroconf api for ros frameworks">
  Convenient wrappers around platform-dependant implementations whose 
  purpose are both to expose a fairly standard sort of api as well 
  as a ros api (topics and services) where practical.
  
  The only implementation it doesn't include is the android (will
  eventually merge back in here if ubuntu starts officially including
  adk packages).
